# RepositoryDesignPattern
<div align="center">
  <h1>RepositoryDesignPattern</h1>
  <p>This project was created using entity, business, data access, and presentation layers following N-tier architecture. ASP.NET Core 7.0 and MVC architecture were utilized, with PostgreSQL database serving as the backend.</p>
  <p>The main purpose of this project is to learn and implement the repository design pattern. By creating generic structures, it aims to prevent repeated implementation of the savechanges method or CRUD operations in the controller.</p>
